        <h1>Month 1: Chess</h1>
        <h2>
          This is Roy. Roy lost his wife a few years ago and has been fairly isolated since. His family mostly live interstate,
          and those who live close are always very busy.  Roy used to play Chess with his wife and really misses the games they had together.
          Roy has said he would love for someone to come and play chess with him sometimes; as it’s one of his favourite pastimes.

      <h1>Month 2: Gardening</h1>
      <h2>
        Bob is Jill’s grandfather and he loves gardening. As Bob has gotten older, Bob isn’t as mobile as he used to be. Jill goes around to Bob’s
        house for an hour a month and helps him with some of the trickier yard work that he can no longer do safely. Bob loves the time he gets
        to spend with Jill and he also loves seeing his garden flourish! #oldmate

      <h1>Month 3: Volunteering at an aged-care facility</h1>
      <h2>
        This is Geoff. Geoff’s family are overseas and the social interaction he gets comes only from activities organised by the aged car
        facility where he lives. Geoff would never ask for help or support; it’s not how his generation was raised to operate, but Geoff
        gets very lonely with no-one to interact with.   Take a pack of cards, your ipod or a chessboard and visit Geoff or someone like him
        in your local aged care facility. #oldmate

      <h2>
        It’s not just the Old Mates in your life that need someone, there are a lot of men in Australia who are in need of friends
        and support networks. Volunteering at an aged-care facility is a great way to connect with Old Mates who really need it:
